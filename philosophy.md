# Philosophy of Vethathiri Maharishi

## God
Not a person, but the unified omnipresent energy â€” the source of all life.

## Universe
A manifestation of energy governed by natural law and cause-effect relationships.

## Consciousness
Through spiritual practice, human consciousness can merge with the cosmic force, revealing the oneness of existence.
